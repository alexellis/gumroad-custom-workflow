# You've been upgraded!

I'm Alex, the founder of OpenFaaS and author of Serverless For Everyone Else.

As part of a promotion for the DevOps Pro tier, you've been given an upgrade to my video workshop. Normally this would cost an extra 50 USD.

## For your eyes only!

Please don't share the URL with anyone else, this is just for you. You must not share or publish the link.

If you think your team could benefit from the workshop, then you can purchase the Team Edition for up to 5 people at a time.

## Show your appreciation and leave a rating

To show your appreciation for the free upgrade, and 50 USD saving, please go ahead and leave a rating on Gumroad. If you feel for any reason that it's not worth the 5 stars for any, then email me and I'll try to help.
